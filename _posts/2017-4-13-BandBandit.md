*Arkells: bringing great energy to live music*

My three months at Metis flew by. The bootcamp was crazy intense, but I learned so much while I was there and met a bunch of really smart and interesting people. I'm excited to post today about my final project at Metis, BandBandit, a music festival and artist recommender. When I have free time, one of my absolute favorite things to do is go see live music. Now that Metis has ended, I'm hoping to squeeze in a few concerts and festivals in between my busy learning and job search schedule. I want to keep the momentum from the bootcamp going, but it's also important to reward yourself for all the hard work! 

The data for this project was compiled from two main sources. Artist and music data was obtained with the [Spotify API](https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/) and festival data was scraped from [Music Festival Wizard](https://www.musicfestivalwizard.com/).
