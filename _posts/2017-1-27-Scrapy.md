For the second project at Metis, we were asked to build a multivariate linear regression model using data that we scraped from the web. In class we learned about BeautifulSoup, a python HTML parsing library, but then one of our TA's put me on to Scrapy, so I decided to try it out for this project. I found that Scrapy had a slightly steaper learning curve than BeautifuilSoup, but once I got the hang of it, I had a ton of fun writing Spiders to crawl all over some websites to collect the data I needed for my project. 

Scrapy is a free and open sourced web scrapping/crawling framework written in Python.  For this post I wanted to list some of the tricks I came accross to make life a little easier for a beginner using Scrapy. If you havent used Scrapy before check out the [tutorial](https://doc.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html) first. It will walk you through the basics.


### robot.txt  
This isn't actually a Scrapy tip but a webscraping tip in general. Always make sure to check the robot.txt file of a website (This is usually found at http://website.com/robot.txt). This text file with tell you if and how you should crawl the website. We want to show respect to the sites we crawl and not harm them.  

### Scrapy Selector
To select elements on a page, we have a choice of CSS or XPath selectors. I suggest learning to use the XPath selector since it allows you to do more than just navigating the structure of a page (See 'Following Links' below for an example). If your using Chrome, an easy way to get the xpath when inspecting a page is to right click the element you want and navaigate to Copy >> Copy XPath.
